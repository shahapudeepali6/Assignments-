Latter is considered good enough as they have sort of uniform distribution. Pseudo random numbers are generated by computers using an algorithm (there are many) and a seed (either chosen by the user or, sometimes, clock time). They are not strictly random as, if you start with the same seed and same algorithm. A truly random number, on the other hand, is completely unpredictable. There is no way to generate a series of truly random numbers via computer; the usual ways are flipping coins, throwing darts, rolling dice and other physical processes."
