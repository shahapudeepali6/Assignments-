In addition, the legend displays information about the points that are currently hovered over or, if none are hovered over, about the last points shown on the plot. The text of a legend item includes the name of a series and, depending on the series type, the value or values of the current or last point. The legend title, enabled by default, shows the current or last date (X-value)."

        "Ans: : The 180-day moving average is represented as a line on charts and represents the average price over the past 180 days. The moving average can give traders a sense regarding whether the trend is up or down, while also identifying potential support or resistance areas. A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator that is commonly used in technical analysis. The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data over a specified period of time by creating a constantly updated average price. A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over the specific number of days in the past; for example, in this case over 180 days."
