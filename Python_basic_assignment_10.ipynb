It primarily takes two arguments src and dest. src represents the file to be copied where as destination refers to the file/folder to where the src data should be copied.

Permissions and times of directories are copied with shutil.copystat() and individual files are copied using shutil.copy2() by default which can be modified using copy_function attribute."
